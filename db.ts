// 
// Regarding TIMESTAMPS, as per suggestion here:
//   
//     http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32033114/javascript-postgres-timezone-and-timestamp-usage
//
//   All Timestamps are stored without timezones, and in UTC time.  So, 
//   for storing dates into the database, use: date.toUTCString(), and when
//   fetching dates from the database, use 'var dt = new Date(dbDateStr + ' UTC').
//
//   See Jobber class' db2Date() and date2Db() methods.

// import {JobState} from "./index";
